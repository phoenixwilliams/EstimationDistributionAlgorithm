# Estimation of Distribution Algorithm Population Repository

*This repository is for learning purposes only and should not be used for
financial gain. 

#### This repository implements the estimation of distribution (EDA) population alorithm
Where most implementations of the EDA algorithm frequently only differ
in the terms of the probabilistic model, this implementation aims to make this
process simpler by allowing a custom built probabilistic model class to be 
used within the implemented algorithm by passing it to optimization class. 

Within this repository 3 Gaussian Probabilistic Models and 1 Discrete
Probabilistic model is implemented with examples of its use.

The research and use of EDAs have decreased with the rise of other optimization
algorithms such as Evolutionary Algorithms, however the use of probabilistic 
models are still largely used in Machine Learning and Optimization. 
The use EDAs is a great and simple way to improve you understanding of probabilistic
models and their abilities, with this implementation allowing user to 
plug-in their own models and see its affect.

Examples of using this implementation can be seen within the Examples.py script.
